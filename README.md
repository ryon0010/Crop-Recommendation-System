ðŸŒ± Crop Recommendation System
This project provides smart crop recommendations based on environmental and nutrient data. By analyzing temperature, humidity, and soil nutrients (N, P, K), the system suggests the most suitable crops for optimal yield.

Features
Data Input: Users can input temperature, humidity, and soil nutrients (N, P, K).
Recommendation Engine: Uses machine learning to predict the best crops for the given conditions.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple interface to input data and view results.
